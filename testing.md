#### As a new user I would like all collectible items to spawn as soon as the game is loaded so it can be played immediately. 

1. Upon opening the game website all boomerangs immediately fall from the top of the screen.

Steps taken:
 * Go to Boomerang Hunter website - https://rdgrover.github.io/Boomerang-Hunter-ms2/.
 * Wait for page to load.
 * Observe boomerangs being created at the top of the screen and falling to interact with platforms below.

#### As a new user I would like the controls to be responsive and for it be clear which direction I am going in.

1. Using the right arrow key moves the player sprite to the right.
1. Using the left arrow key moves the player sprite to the left.
1. Using the up arrow key allows player sprite to jump, but only if they are on the ground or a platform.
1. While jumping using the right arrow key moves the player sprite to the right.
1. While jumping using the left arrow key moves the player sprite to the left. 

Steps taken: 
 * Press the right arrow key and observe sprite animated running right and moving to the right of the screen.
 * Press the left arrow key and observe sprite animated running left and moving to the left of the screen.
 * Press the up arrow key and observe the sprite moving up the screen and then back down. 
 * Press the up arrow key when not touching the ground or platform and observe that the sprite will not jump.
 * Press the right arrow key after pressing the up arrow key and observe the sprite animated running right and moving to the right of the screen.
 * Press the left arrow key after pressing the up arrow key and observe the sprite animated running left and moving to the left of the screen.

#### As a new user I would like it to be apparent how objects interact with the level.

1. Once the player sprite appears it should land on the ground.
1. The player should be unable to move beyond the game screen because of the walls at either side of the screen.
1. The player should be able to land on the moving platfroms and not jump through them. 

Steps taken:
 * Once the page has loaded observe the sprite drop down on to the ground.
 * Using the left arrow key the sprite will make the sprite move until it hits the wall and can no longer move.
 * Using the right arrow key the sprite will make the sprite move until it hits the wall and can no longer move.
 * Using the up arrow key to make the sprite jump observe it not jump through the moving platform if the platform is above.
 * Using the up arrow key to make the sprite jump observe the sprite land on the moving platform provided there is no platform above when jumping.

1. Once boomerangs appear at the top of the screen they should land on the moving platforms or the ground.
1. The boomerangs will not be able to go through the walls at the end of the screen.

Steps taken:
 * Once the page has loaded observe the boomerangs drop from the top of the screen.
 * Observe that the boomerangs will bounce but settle on the ground and platforms.
 * Collect the first seven boomerangs to make others appear.
 * Observe the random spawning of the boomerangs. 
 * Since they appear randomly and the platforms are constantly in motion there is a possibility they will bounce towards the wall, if this happens observe they bounce off the wall.

1. When the dynamite is created it will bounce around the screen.
1. It will bounce off of the walls, ground and moving platforms.

Steps taken:
 * Move the sprite around the screen to collect the first seven boomerangs which appear.
 * Observe the first dynamite being created at the top of the screen.
 * Observe the dynamite bounce off of the moving platforms, walls and ground. 
 * If it is underneath a platform observe it not pass through the platform but rather will bounce of the underside of the platform. 

#### As a new user I would like it to be clear when interacting with the boomerangs they are being collected.

1. Once the boomerang and the sprite are touching the boomerang will be collected and disappear.
1. The points in the corner will increase by 100 points to show how many have been collected.

Steps taken: 
 * Use the arrow keys to move the player sprite towards the nearest boomerang.
 * Observe once the sprite makes contact with the boomerang the boomerang disappears.
 * Observe the points value in the corner increase by 100 for every boomerang collected.

#### As a new user I would like the consequence of the dynamite to be apparent.
