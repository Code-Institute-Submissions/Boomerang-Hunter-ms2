# Overview 
* I wanted to design an homage to old-school platformer games, designed to be played on a desktop. There are simple controls and colourful design with the goal of creating a game that anyone could play but predominantely appeals to children. I liked the idea of creating something that seemed simple but you can spend hours replaying it to try and beat your best score. The aesthetic of the game is also my way of harkening back to arcade era game, with pixelated backgrounds and a sprite designed with pixel art. I chose to do this because I wanted to create something that seemed familiar and had a nostaligic feel to it whilst still creating something brand new and adding my own design to the 8-bit game style.
