## UX

### 1.1 Overview 

* When beginning the project I knew I wanted to create a game and was told about the Phaser library by my mentor. Using certain aspects of the library, particularly the physics simulations it was easier to create my own code to create the game. I wanted to design an homage to old-school platformer games, designed to be played on a desktop. There are simple controls and colourful design with the goal of creating a game that anyone could play but predominantely appeals to children.

### 1.2 Project Goals 

* I liked the idea of creating something that seemed simple but you can spend hours replaying it to try and beat your best score. The aesthetic of the game is also my way of harkening back to arcade era game, with pixelated backgrounds and a sprite designed with pixel art. I chose to do this because I wanted to create something that seemed familiar and had a nostaligic feel to it whilst still creating something brand new and adding my own design to the 8-bit game style. I also wanted to create a game that didn't have a way to end the game by reaching a certain score, so that means the user is only trying to beat their own previous scores. 

### 1.3 User Goals

* A user would want simple graphics which are easy to understand and aren't overwhelming to look at.
* A user would want controls which are easy to understand and conform to general conventions of desktop games.
* A user would also want the controls to be accessible to view so that the user can become comfortable with the game before starting to play, but may also want to access the instructions during the game and they can do so at any time.
* A user would want to be able to see clearly that they are collecting items and that each item earns points.

## Features

### 2.1 Game Board

* The level has a fixed background of desert, sky and cacti which helps to immerse you in the game and give it depth. There are three seperate platforms each moving between their own parameters at their own set speeds. The lowest platform moving the fastest, the middle platform moving at a medium speed and the highest platform moving the slowest.

### 2.2 Sprite 

* The sprite for the kangaroo main character was created using a programme called Piskel. Which allowed for the creation of multiple frames of the sprite and allowed it to be animated so it isn't just a static image that moves around the screen. This allows you to understand what direction your character is travelling in whether on the ground or in the air. There are ten frames of movement, five for left and five for right moves, and an extra frame for the stationary model. 

### 2.3 Style and Theme

* The game is based around an Australian design. It is made to look like the Australian outback with the desert plants and the orange colour scheme which is reminiscent of Australian soil. The main character is a kangaroo, the national animal of the country and the collectibles in the game are made to look like boomerangs. The primary font used for the game is ZCOOL KuaiLe and it was chosen specifically because it looks like a wild font that was reminiscent of games like Crash Bandicoot. 

### 2.4 Instructions Modal

* A modal was placed next to the title above the game window which shows you the instructions of how to play the game. As the game has quite simplistic controls and it is designed to be visually understood without context you can play the game without reading through the instructions. However, because the modal is always present you can look at the instructions at any time. 


### 2.5 Features To Be Implemented 
  
  * With more time I would have liked to have added music to the game to help the immersive experience.

## Acknowledgements
  
 * Phaser Library was helpful in inspiring my project and had an abundance of physics simulators which were essential to the construction of this game.
 * Piskel was used to create the kangaroo, boomerang and dynamite sprites as well as the background clouds, ground, walls and cacti.
 * I gained a lot of inspiration for this game from old-school platformers like Super Mario. 
 * And special thanks to my mentor Spencer Bariball who showed me the Phaser library and was incredibly helpful every step of the way.
