## UX

### 1.1 Overview 
* When beginning the project I knew I wanted to create a game and was told about the Phaser library by my mentor. Using certain aspects of the library, particularly the physics simulations it was easier to create my own code to create the game. I wanted to design an homage to old-school platformer games, designed to be played on a desktop. There are simple controls and colourful design with the goal of creating a game that anyone could play but predominantely appeals to children.

### 1.2 Project Goals 
* I liked the idea of creating something that seemed simple but you can spend hours replaying it to try and beat your best score. The aesthetic of the game is also my way of harkening back to arcade era game, with pixelated backgrounds and a sprite designed with pixel art. I chose to do this because I wanted to create something that seemed familiar and had a nostaligic feel to it whilst still creating something brand new and adding my own design to the 8-bit game style. I also wanted to create a game that didn't have a way to end the game by reaching a certain score, so that means the user is only trying to beat their own previous scores. 

### 1.3 User Goals
* A user would want simple graphics which are easy to understand and aren't overwhelming to look at.
* A user would want controls which are easy to understand and conform to general conventions of desktop games.
* A user would also want the controls to be accessible to view so that the user can become comfortable with the game before starting to play, but may also want to access the instructions during the game and they can do so at any time.
* A user would want to be able to see clearly that they are collecting items and that each item earns points.
